# Hi there ðŸ‘‹  
## I'm Daniel Hammersley and I'm an aspiring Data Scientist!    
  
  
  
### I'm currently working on... 
uploading my projects to github. These include some fun tasks I completed for the freeCodeCamp Python certification such as:
* [Artihmetic Arranger](https://github.com/danham78/arithmetic_arranger) - a nice string formatting excercise - I'm aiming to refactor this to make better use of functions
* Time Calculator - more involved than it looks at first - no datetime allowed...
* Budget App - for keeping track of spends. Also includes a nice little bar chart visualisation function
* Shape Calculator - an OOP excercise
* [Probability Calculator](https://github.com/danham78/prob_calculator) - designed to approximate probability by repeating an experiment
